Full refresh will truncate and recompute ALL tables in this pipeline from scratch. This can lead to data loss for non-idempotent sources. Are you sure you want to full refresh?
in cdc, key specified column should be unique, else only one row gets selected and other record goes missing

emp_name	course_id	course_completed	order_id	order_ts	age	_rescued_data
null	1	Record_deleted	null	2025-09-04 10:31:00	null	{"age":null,"_file_path":"/Volumes/workspace/default/course2/sample2.parquet"}
rohit	2	Y	34	2025-09-04 10:31:00	null	{"age":24.0,"_file_path":"/Volumes/workspace/default/course2/sample2.parquet"}

rescued data helps to run code even if some records are corrupt, just marks them as corrupt due to whatever issues.
