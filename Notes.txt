course 2
Full refresh will truncate and recompute ALL tables in this pipeline from scratch. This can lead to data loss for non-idempotent sources. Are you sure you want to full refresh?
in cdc, key specified column should be unique, else only one row gets selected and other record goes missing

emp_name	course_id	course_completed	order_id	order_ts	age	_rescued_data
null	1	Record_deleted	null	2025-09-04 10:31:00	null	{"age":null,"_file_path":"/Volumes/workspace/default/course2/sample2.parquet"}
rohit	2	Y	34	2025-09-04 10:31:00	null	{"age":24.0,"_file_path":"/Volumes/workspace/default/course2/sample2.parquet"}

rescued data helps to run code even if some records are corrupt, just marks them as corrupt due to whatever issues.

#data governance in unity catalog

unity catalog a standard which can support it all- structured and unstructured data
access control- cloud location for catalog metastore, and a permission role needed, IAM for aws, spn/managed_identity for azure

what catalogs we get depends on the workspace we are in.
workspace is at top right, like a region, like us-east
different catalog for different workspaces

catalogs are like repositories for your schemas
why need catalog? to partition your data assets

schemas are repositories for 5 objects- table, view, volume, functions, model

managed vs external tables

volume like a library, also has managed vs external
can put photo in volume and query it, or a json file

check if you can connect to external sql source and query its table, postgre or whatever

sample data, history, lineage, permission in catalog for any table


##populate metastore

use catalog catalog_name; use schema schema_name;
insert overwrite table_name values
(a,b,c),
(d,e,f)

catalog explorer = katalogam in jio





Summary-
Explain the importance of data governance and challenges in traditional data lake environments.
Differentiate between managed and external tables, and evaluate the architecture of Unity Catalog.
Utilize SQL commands to navigate and inspect metastore components, and assess data segregation strategies.
Identify query lifecycle steps and Databricks roles for effective data governance and security within Unity Catalog.
Implement privilege assignments and fine-grained access control strategies using SQL syntax and dynamic views in Databricks.
Assess the effectiveness and implications of different privilege scenarios, inheritance models, and access control mechanisms in Unity Catalog.
